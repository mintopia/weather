# Weather OBS Overlay

## Introduction

This is a simple overlay intended to be used with a Browser Source in OBS or similar software. It renders basic weather information and time, and keeps it updated using some simple Javascript.

## Usage

Upload the files to some public webhosting. You will need to edit index.php to provide a location for the saved weather data, this must be writable by your webserver. You must also provide an API Key for the [Dark Sky Weather Service](https://www.darksky.net).

You can set a longitude and latitude for the weather location as well.

Once it is setup, you can test it in your browser, if it works you can add it to your OBS scene collection.

## Issues and Feedback

Please raise all issues and feedback on GitHub at [mintopia/weather](https://github.com/mintopia/weather/issues).

I can be contacted at jess@mintopia.net and an example of this in-use can sometimes be seen on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/mintopia).
